      <p class="introText">I love extreme sports because they are flashy and based on skills. For me programming is the same in it's core, skill is visible and it comes from invested time.</p>
      <p class="introText">I started learning agriculture and got a Master's degree in plant protection because it is close to my family. While doing so my favorite topics were always the ones that involved applying the latest technologies. I worked at an agronomic chemical research institute and after a while I realized that my favorite part  was working on the technical side so I started to learn programming in my free time. I enjoyed the process of it so much that I decided to take a leap of faith and join a boot camp.</p>
