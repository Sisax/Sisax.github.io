      <p class="introText">I love wandering in the nature and doing activities outdoors so I started learning agriculture, while doing so my favorite topics were always the ones that involved applying the latest technologies. I worked at an agronomic chemical research institute and after a while I realized that my favirote part  was working on the technical side so I started to learn programming in my freetime. I enjoyed the process of it so much that I decided to take a leap of faith and join a boot camp.</p>
